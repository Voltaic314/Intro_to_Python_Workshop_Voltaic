# This is a workshop I set up for a few discord friends but I recorded all the lectures and made them public for the world to see. 

Here is the playlist of videos on YouTube:

Please note that my mic quality in one or two of these vids is not great and then also I have now invested in a pop filter so at some point the pops will get better depending on when you find this. 

Also note that these videos are not organized in any specific way right now so for now it's kind of all over the place and still many other things I need to cover in the series (as of writing this). Maybe by the time you find this it will be better. But at least as of writing this, it is not currently the best.
